  <h2>Darien Rouse</h2>
  <p class="description">My name is Darien Rouse, I grew up in Ankeny, Iowa where I learned to put in the time and work. I enjoy Bike rides and video games like Smash Bros, these activities helped spur the idea to take photos and editing with multiple programs. I’ve had multiple years of audio set-up and video editing between Ankeny Centennial weekly videos and Church podcasts. I’ve done several years of photoshop and graphic design, including to help promote an Ankeny Film Festival. I used to not be great with technology, but in recent years have spent a large time on game assets and photography. I’m still willing to learn and wanting to help people out in my community in any way I can. “Hardwork only pays off if you’re willing to put in the learning”.</p>
